    <p>
      (<em>from</em> Hamlet, <em>spoken by Hamlet</em>) <br /><br /><br />
      To be, or not to be, that is the question:<br />
      Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br />
      The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br />
      Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,<br />
      And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep<br />
      No more; and by a sleep, to say we end<br />
      The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks<br />
      That Flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation<br />
      Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,<br />
      To sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there's the rub,<br />
      For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,<br />
      For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,<br />
      Must give us pause. There's the respect<br />
      That makes Calamity of so long life:<br />
      For who would bear the Whips and Scorns of time,<br />
      The Oppressor's wrong, the proud man's Contumely,<br />
      The pangs of dispised Love, the Lawâ€™s delay,<br />
      The insolence of Office, and the spurns<br />
      That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<br />
      When he himself might his Quietus make<br />
      With a bare Bodkin? Who would Fardels bear,<br />
      To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br />
      But that the dread of something after death,<br />
      The undiscovered country, from whose bourn<br />
      No traveller returns, puzzles the will,<br />
      And makes us rather bear those ills we have,<br />
      Than fly to others that we know not of.<br />
      Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,<br />
      And thus the native hue of Resolution<br />
      Is sicklied o'er, with the pale cast of Thought,<br />
      And enterprises of great pitch and moment,<br />
      With this regard their Currents turn awry,<br />
      And lose the name of Action. Soft you now,<br />
      The fair Ophelia? Nymph, in thy Orisons<br />
      Be all my sins remember'd.
